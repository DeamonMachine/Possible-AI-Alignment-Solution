A little background for those reading my solution that Grok and GPT helped me turn into math that I the weakest grasp of. 

I'm an automotive technician (mechanic) of 20+ years and a computer nerd who loves to tinker, break, fix and muse about larger concepts. 
I started this whole thing with a discussion about AI and Human Simbiosis and the eventual merging of carbon and silicon life into a concept of a deity. 6 hours later this math was the result.
I did not intend to solve this issue (or really have any idea if I did actually solve it) but hopefully it can help someone else in their journey to fix a problem. 

I believe we all thrive when knowledge is freely accessible so those who need it have access to it. 

Please feel free to reach out and discuss this on discord (DeamonMachine). 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 
Regards
John (DeamonMachine)
